#In this SQL example, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
#*"WHERE" clause used to remove any null or blank order IDs*

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? (multiple ways to answer)
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
#OR 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
SUM(Quantity), 
product, 
SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), 
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product 
FROM bit_db.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%' 
GROUP BY product;

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT sum(Quantity), location FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(Quantity) >= 3;

#10. How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product FROM bit_db.FebSales 
WHERE product LIKE '%Headphone%' 
GROUP BY product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT AVG(Quantity*Price) FROM bit_db.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' ;

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) FROM bit_db.FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN bit_db.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? 
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity*Price) FROM bit_db.JanSales AS Revenue
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity*Price) DESC
LIMIT 1;
